-----------------
Cloudmesh Docker
-----------------

Objective:
----------

This project's objective is to develop docker client interface for cloudmesh. Docker is an open source project that providies a layer of abstraction and automation of operating system-level virtualization on Linux. It automates the deployment of applications inside software containers.


Project requirements:
---------------------

(1) Deploying docker server (Amazon EC2 instances used here) 
(1) Developing commandline interface for docker client to integrate with existing cloudmesh shell.

Design:
-------

(1) Cloudmesh server is configured on Linux Ubuntu box.
(2) When we start the cloudmesh shell, the docker client is loaded and the data is stored in mongodb with three collections defined - Cloudmeshdocker, Images and Containers. The data is persistent throughout the connection.
(3) REST API calls are made for docker usage.

Usage:
------

(1) docker container create, docker container delete, etc.

Limitations/Issues:
-------------------

(1) Currently docker attach(docker run) doesn't work (Need to figure out how to use stdin,stdout for this). Other workaround can be to use remote ssh.
(2) Currently supports only one cloud
(3) Docker server needs to be configured on secure port. Currently, it is public for anyone to access it.
